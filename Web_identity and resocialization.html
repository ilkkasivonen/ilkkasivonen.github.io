I can live with the advertising, but I hate being sucked into being a co-editor of a media platform. There is no way to participate without adopting the idea that it is cool (acceptable and valuable) behaviour to wave your identity in front of everyone. And don&#39;t get me wrong, I mostly don&#39;t have anything against most people&#39;s life choices and I&#39;m lucky to know some very lovely people... but holy cow I hate how the very things that make us sometimes sparkle get reduced into endless, lifeless stream of marketing valued by shitty algorithms.</p><p>There are very few things I feel so strongly about that I would be willing to represent them as part of my identity - only two come to my mind: The first would be my family, but I value the privacy of my family as much I value mine, so there is that. The second would be the environment, but there is really nothing anyone can buy that would make the world a better place, so no, I will not share what I did yesterday. No tech platform or company will solve social or environmental issues, as long as they force our identities and social roles to adhere to marketing.</p><p>(Note: This is not an exhaustive list of things I care about and I know my privileged position.)</p><p>So I find myself desocialized without a way to resocialize. Not because I don&#39;t value my friends, but because I don&#39;t value how the platforms that have taken over our communication.</p></section><footer id="about"><p></p><h2 id="about-me">About me</h2><p><a href="./assets/images/me_400x400.jpeg"><img src="./assets/images/me_200x200.jpeg" width="200px" height="200px" class="happyface" alt="That is me, Ilkka Sivonen"></a></p><p>Software developer, consultant and freelancer with a day job.</p><p>I have been crafting web pages since late 90&#39;s, used to run (unsuccessful) SW startup and work in business consulting for manufacturing in 10&#39;s.
