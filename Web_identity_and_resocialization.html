I can live with the advertising, but I hate being sucked into being a co-editor of a media platform. There is no way to participate without adopting the idea that it is cool (acceptable and valuable) behaviour to wave your bought identity (bought/designed not the actual human self) in front of everyone. And don&#39;t get me wrong, I mostly don&#39;t have anything against most people&#39;s life choices... but holy cow I hate how the very things that make us sometimes sparkle get reduced into endless, lifeless stream of marketing valued by and manufactured into caricatures by shitty algorithms.</p><p>There are very few things I feel so strongly about that I would be willing to represent them as part of my identity - only two come to my mind: The first would be my family, but I value the privacy of my family as much I value mine, so there is that. The second would be the environment, but there is really nothing anyone can buy that would make the world a better place, so no, I will not share what I did yesterday. No tech platform or company will solve social or environmental issues, as long as they force our identities and social roles to adhere to marketing.</p><p>(Note: This is not an exhaustive list of things I care about and I know my privileged position.)</p><p>So I find myself desocialized without a way to resocialize. Not because I don&#39;t value my friends, but because I don&#39;t value how the platforms that have taken over our communication. See you IRL!</p></section><footer><h2 id="about">About</h2><p>A product minded developer, consultant and freelancer with a day job, interested in various mixtures of learning, ethics, data and related technology topics</p><p>I&#39;ve been crafting web pages since late 90&#39;s, ran a (unsuccessful) SW startup and worked in business consulting for manufacturing in the 10&#39;s.
